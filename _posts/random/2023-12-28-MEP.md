I had the extraordinary honour of attending the Model European Parliament (MEP) in Berlin. 
Basically, this is an opportunistic capitalist event full of hypocritical teenagers who try to convey little meaning with a lot of palaver. This whole infernal event is carried out in a suit, but the evening programme was -well- awesome...
Viva la revoluci√≥n!
