I had an earworm of the song for ages after watching “Almost Famous”, so I tried to cover it.  (2024)

This is another birthday song for my friend Anne's 18th birthday. This song was also written spontaneously. The chords are pretty basic and the vocals are monotonous, but it's the gesture that counts, isn't it? (2024)

We were at my place with our American exchange students, when we spontaneously started recording. I play the guitar and my guy Jack Peterson sings with this wonderful warm and light voice. He does the main singing, although two other voices from the exchange support him at times, which creates some cool harmonies. (2023)

This was a birthday song for a friend named Nathan with loads of irony and insider jokes.
I admit that it is a little bit of a poor text, but I like the melody though. (2023)
