I'm really into living a healthy life. Especially because I find that it correlates pretty strongly with living a happy life. Since I spent a lot of time thinking about what I can do to optimise it, I thought I'd start sharing some of my insights, my routines, and generally food for thought.

Feel free to browse through what I share in my [collections]({{'/collections'| prepend: site.baseurl}}). Hope it helps!
